# oolong
A very small and hopefully effective library for quickly making TUI (sorta a terminal GUI) applications. Oolong aims to manage more rendering the screen than anything else, the actual logic is left largely to the application itself (see project in `example/`).

## Getting Started
The headers files should provide most if not all of the required documentation, the example project should help get you off the ground too. To use in a project just bring the headers with you and compile your project with the static library (can be built with the `build.sh` script, when I start making releases you'll be able to find it there too).
